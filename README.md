# Description
This is a Game called Tenzies. The game is played by choosing a number, let's say 6, when i say the number in another box i click and "hold" it. If there is no other 6 you roll. The goal is to basically hold and roll until all the numbers are the same.

# Lessons Learnt
During the development of the game I mostly practiced dealing with react logic.
I also practised using containerization using Docker.
